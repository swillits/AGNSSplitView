AGNSSplitViewDelegate
=============

AGNSSplitViewDelegate is designed to be generic splitview delegate. The problem with 
splitviews is that some things which should be simple require implementing unintuitive
delegate methods, which gets to be pretty annoying.

For example, even setting a minimum and maximum width for a subview is not trivial. 
After coming across Matt Gallagher's blog post for priority-based resizing in 
splitviews, I knew I could use it as is, but took it to the next level. 

AGNSSplitViewDelegate lets you:

- Specificy uniform, proportional, or priority-based resizing
- Specify min/max sizes for subviews.
- Specify whether a subview can collapse
- Specify which subview is collapsed by a double-click on a divider
- Add a block handler for divider effective rects

Normally to do any of these things you'd have to implement delegate methods yourself 
(over and over), but now you can just create a generic delegate, call some setters, 
and you're done.

Note: This code hasn't been proven bulletproof, but it's working great so far for me.



AGNSSplitView
=============

AGNSSplitView is a light NSSplitView subclass. All it does is give some control over 
divider thickness and style with a couple of writable properties. 

- dividerThickness;
- drawsDivider;
- dividerColor;
- dividerLineEdge;
- drawsDividerHandle;
- dividerDrawingHandler;

Nothing major, but here if you want it.



Requirements
=============

There are no OS requirements for this code. It'll work in the old and new
runtimes, does not use garbage collection, and is not ARC-ified yet.
